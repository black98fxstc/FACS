<title>Logicle Data Scale</title>
</head>
<body>
Provides an implementation of the Logicle data scale and its inverse.
The Logicle data scale is a generalization of the inverse hyperbolic sine function 
or <code>arcsinh</code>.
Like <code>arcsinh</code> it is logarithmic for large data values, linear
in the neighborhood of zero, symmetric around zero and changes smoothly between
the log and linear regions.
It is more general because the width of the linear region can be independently controlled.
The scale is parameterized by the choice of a number of decades of data range to cover, 
the maximum data value on scale and the width of the linear region.
It is used in flow cytometry where a large dynamic range of data, most suitable for a
logarithmic scale, is present along with other data distributed near zero
and including negative values, for which an ordinary logarithmic scale is not suitable.
