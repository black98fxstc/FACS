Special things about DiVa;

1.  If the user sets up their controls using DiVa mechanisms, the controls come out as
*** Stained Control  and Unstained Control in the tube name.

2.  If the control is just one per detector, the 'name' of the detector is given by this
convention.  So it says FITC Stained Control for example.  FITC would be the name of the detector
given in the configuration file, I suppose.  It is the name that DiVa knows about anyway.

3.  To match this with a detector name, one would add on a -A on the end and the link it
to the index on the detector list. Then there is no <labels> <fl> <label> </label></fl></labels>
in the xml file.

4.  If the user is setting up the tandems, I mean multiple reagents on one detector, then
the DiVa convention is  to give the <name of the reagent><name of the detector> and these and
then listed in the XML file as <labels><fl><Label></label></fl></labels>
