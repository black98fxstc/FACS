<title>Data Transforms for Cytometry</title>
</head>
<body>
Provides an implementation of the standard display transformations used in flow cytometry.
The design goals of this implementation, aside from the essential computational one,  are
first to make these transformations comprehensible to the end users, i.e., scientists and
secondly to ease the burden to implementers.
To achieve the later, all transforms are implemented so that the 
{@link edu.stanford.facs.transform.Transform#scale(double) scale} method maps
an appropriate range of data values onto a standard unit display interval [0,1] and the 
{@link edu.stanford.facs.transform.Transform#inverse(double)  inverse}
mapping is always implemented.
Note that this implementation will map data values outside the range without complaint and in a sensible
way but with results falling outside the unit interval and possibly with reduced precision.

<p>
To make the transforms comprehensible they are all defined in terms of a consistent parameterization 
that is closely related to the user experience. 
All transforms are parameterized by the top of scale value <code>T</code>, which is always
mapped to scale position <code>1</code>. 
In addition, the logarithmic and log like transforms are parameterized
by <code>M</code>, the number of decades of data range mapped onto the unit display interval
by the {@link edu.stanford.facs.transform.Logarithmic} transform.
The log like scales are also parameterized by <code>W</code> and <code>A</code>, which are commensurate
with decades on the scale although they do not represent ten fold changes in data value. 
<code>W</code> controls the degree of linearization for the the {@link edu.stanford.facs.transform.Logicle} 
and {@link edu.stanford.facs.transform.Hyperlog} transforms.
The parameter <code>A</code> specifies an an additional range of negative data values that are
to be brought on scale.
For the {@link edu.stanford.facs.transform.Logicle} and {@link edu.stanford.facs.transform.Hyperlog} 
transforms this is in addition to what is already brought on scale by <code>W</code> and should
generally not be needed.
The {@link edu.stanford.facs.transform.Logicle}, {@link edu.stanford.facs.transform.Hyperlog} and 
{@link edu.stanford.facs.transform.Arcsinh} transforms with <code>A = 0</code>
will all behave like the {@link edu.stanford.facs.transform.Logarithmic} transform with the same values
of <code>T</code> and <code>M</code> for large data values.
</p>
This choice of parameters also leads to a sensible fall back strategy when software does not
implement a particular transform.
For example if the logicle transform is not available a hyperlog transform with the same parameters
should be a reasonable alternative and vice versa.
In cases where neither is available 
{@link edu.stanford.facs.transform.Arcsinh#Arcsinh(double, double, double) Arcsinh(T, M, W + A)} 
although almost never be really satisfactory will at least map the same data range onto the 
unit display interval.
Finally it should be noted that 
{@link edu.stanford.facs.transform.Arcsinh#Arcsinh(double, double, double) Arcsinh(T, M, A)} 
is completely equivalent to 
{@link edu.stanford.facs.transform.Logicle#Logicle(double, double, double, double) Logicle(T, M, 0, A)}
so it is not strictly necessary to implement the arcsinh transform as a separate class.
On is provided here primarily to fix the relevant formulas.
<p>

<p>
This is a reference implementation, generally accurate to double precision in the standard display interval.
It is reasonably fast but highly optimized routines with lower precision that are still perfectly adequate 
for use in flow cytometry may be several times faster.
