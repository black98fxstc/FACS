Now I need to mark the points with levels.  
1.  start with the outer triangle.  Locate the 'other' endpoint for the points in the outer triangle.
2.  These endpoints are the next level.  
3.  Build some kind of tree to maintain this information.
4.  Keep building in assigning points to a level that have not already assigned.  
5.  At some point, there will be a 'cluster' that part of it will continue descending, thus
forming two clusters and a set of points that is the division or divitrix or something between
these two clusters.  
6.  similar to annealing.
